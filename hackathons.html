								<h3>University of Twente, Netherlands (Exchange Program)</h3>
							</header>
							<p>I will be spending the first half of 2021 at Enschede, Netherlands. Its because I've bagged an opportunity to take up graduate-level courses and project-work at the University of Twente,Netherlands as a part of Amrita's exchange program. The amazing courses which I will be taking there include Advanced Computer Vision, Information retrieval, Time Series Analysis and many others. Some of these courses come with a project component and that is going to make this entire journey way more exciting.<br> <b style="color:chartreuse">Insider news:</b> A solo europe trip is very much possible.

								<h3>Quantum Computing program by IBM & The Coding School.</h3>
							</header>
							<p>The Coding School in collaboration with IBM started an initiative to teach selected students both theoretical as well as programming concepts in Quantum Computing via a six month long program. Quantum Computing is an exciting field and it works on principles that are not only different from classical computing but in many ways also better than it. I am lucky to be one among those selected for this program and look forward to experimenting with the knowledge I'll gain from this.</p>
